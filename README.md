Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets/data

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of a bank's marketing campaign by examining customer demographics, financial status, and past interactions. The analysis will provide insights into customer behavior and identify key factors influencing whether a client subscribes to a term deposit.

## Goals
The main objective of this project is to provide actionable insights for improving the bank's marketing strategy. Specifically to answer the following questions:

**Customer Profiling**
1. What are the key characteristics of customers who subscribe to a term deposit?
2. What are the most common demographic and financial traits of potential subscribers?
   
**Campaign Effectiveness**
1. How successful was the last marketing campaign?
2. What factors contributed to campaign success or failure?
   
**Key Influencing Factors**
1. How does past interaction with the bank influence the likelihood of subscription?
   
**Predictive Analysis**
1. Which model performs best in predicting customer behavior?
2. Which features are most important in model building?

## Conclusions

Based on the analysis, the key insights regarding factors affecting the subscription outcome for the bank's marketing campaign are:

1. **Customer Profiling Majority**: Most of targets are aged 30-50 years old. The most common jobs among target are blue-collar workers, management, and technicians. However, students and retirees have the highest subscription rates. Single individuals have a slightly higher subscription rate than married or divorced individuals. Target with high education are more likely to subscribe. Targets without credit defaults or personal loans have a significantly higher subscription rate.
2. **Campaign Effectiveness**: The highest number of campaigns occurred in May, July, and August while March, September, and December had lower contact volumes but higher success rates. Most of the successful subscriptions occurred with fewer contacts, longer conversations, and follow-ups that happened shortly after the previous contact.
3. **Key Influencing Factors**: The Majority of targets have very low bank balances but those with higher balances show a slightly higher subscription rate. Most campaign communication was conducted via mobile phone/cellular, this method yields a higher subscription rate compared to other methods. Past campaign success is a strong indicator of future subscriptions, targets who previously subscribed are more likely to do so again.
4. **Predictive Analysis**: The model demonstrates overfitting and performs well in identifying negative cases (non-subscribers) but struggles with identifying positive cases (subscribers). From the correlation analysis result, most variables show weak relationships. The strongest correlation observed between past campaign success and subscription likelihood

## Business Recomendation

1. Prioritize students and retirees and focus on targets with tertiary or higher education as they have a higher subscription rate and are more likely to subscribe.
2. Consider targets with blue-collar, management, and technician jobs as they are the most numerous. Offer interesting deals so that they are interested in subscribing.
3. Considering credit history, targets without defaults or personal loans have a higher chance of subscribing.
4. Over-contacting is ineffective, focus on effective follow-ups instead.
5. Prioritize longer call durations to engage targets and utilize past data because targets who subscribed before are more likely to subscribe again.
6. Leverage successful months like September and December for more effective marketing efforts and ensure follow-ups happen promptly.
